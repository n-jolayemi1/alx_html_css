Implementing from scratch a webpage from a designer file.


For this first project, you will focus on the HTML structure only - no CSS, no style - just pure HTML semantic.

The designer file will be available on Figma - feel free to create an account to access the final result there:

Page in Figma
fig file
And “Duplicate to your Drafts” to have access to all design details.
